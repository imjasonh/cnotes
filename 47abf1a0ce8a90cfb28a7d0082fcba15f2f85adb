  "conversation_excerpt": "Tool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now I need to update the parsing to track the last event time:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me update the parsing to track the last event time:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now I need to update the root command to store the last event time in the note:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/root.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/root.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's build and test this fix:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o cnotes \u0026\u0026 cp cnotes /Users/jason/go/bin/cnotes\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me make a test commit to see if the deduplication is working:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/README.md\n\nTool (TodoWrite): {\"todos\":[{\"content\":\"Fix duplicate content between commits by implementing proper deduplication\",\"id\":\"12\",\"priority\":\"high\",\"status\":\"completed\"}]}\n\nTool (Bash): git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Implement proper deduplication using last event timestamp tracking\"\n\nTool (Bash): ./cnotes show HEAD | grep -B5 \"The notes for the latest commit\"\n\n🤖 Claude: Good! The latest commit now properly shows only the content since the previous commit. I can see:\n1. It includes the user prompt \"The notes for the latest commit include prompts and responses from ...\n\nTool (Bash): ./cnotes show HEAD | head -40\n\n🤖 Claude: Perfect! The deduplication is now working correctly. The commit shows:\n1. All events since the previous commit (no duplicates)\n2. The user prompts that triggered the work\n3. All the tool uses and r...\n\nTool (Bash): git push\n\n🤖 Claude: The deduplication fix has been successfully implemented! The system now:\n1. Tracks the last processed event timestamp in each git note\n2. Uses this timestamp to avoid capturing duplicate content in...\n\n🧑 User: Let's prevent installation when the command is in /tmp -- this generally means someone is running `go run ./ install` which we should not make easy.\\\n\\\nAlso, #remember to build with `go build -o $G...\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll add a check to prevent installation from /tmp directories and update our build process.\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test the restriction and then build properly:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o /tmp/cnotes \u0026\u0026 /tmp/cnotes install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A3 \"cannot install\"\n\n🧑 User: We want to use os.TempDir instead of hard-coding MacOS's temp dir\n\n🤖 Claude: You're right, let's use `os.TempDir()` for a more portable solution.\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test this and then build properly:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o /tmp/cnotes \u0026\u0026 /tmp/cnotes install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A3 \"cannot install\"\n\n🤖 Claude: I see the settings file has some duplicate entries with /tmp/cnotes. Let me fix that and continue with the test:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o /tmp/test-cnotes \u0026\u0026 /tmp/test-cnotes install 2\u003e\u00261 | head -5\n\n🤖 Claude: The check isn't working because the log happens before the check. Let me fix the order:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: I see the issue - the log happens after the check but it still proceeded. Let me check if os.TempDir() returns a path with trailing slash:\n\nTool (Bash): echo \"TempDir: $(go run -e 'package main; import (\"fmt\"; \"os\"); func main() { fmt.Print(os.TempDir()) }' 2\u003e\u00261 | tail -1)\"\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me create a simple test program:\n\nTool (Bash): cat \u003c\u003c 'EOF' \u003e /tmp/test.go\npackage main\nimport (\"fmt\"; \"os\")\nfunc main() { fmt.Printf(\"TempDir: %q\\n\", os.TempDir()) }\nEOF \u0026\u0026 go run /tmp/test.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me debug the issue directly:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test it again:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o /tmp/test-cnotes2 \u0026\u0026 /tmp/test-cnotes2 install 2\u003e\u00261 | head -5\n\n🤖 Claude: The issue is that the error check happens after the log statement. Let me look at where the logging happens:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: I see - we do the check AFTER the log statement. Let me move the check to happen before the uninstall/install logic:\n\nTool (MultiEdit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test it:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o /tmp/test-cnotes3 \u0026\u0026 /tmp/test-cnotes3 install 2\u003e\u00261 | head -5\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me check where the log statement is - it seems it's happening before the check:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o /tmp/test \u0026\u0026 /tmp/test install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -E \"(cannot install|INFO installing)\"\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me see where this log statement is coming from. First, let me reread the current state:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Ah, I see line 90 has the log statement happening AFTER the check. The issue might be that the check is failing. Let me trace through the issue with a debug binary:\n\nToo...",
