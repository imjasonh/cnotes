  "conversation_excerpt": "Tool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me check the current state of the file:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test that `go run` is properly blocked:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o ~/go/bin/cnotes \u0026\u0026 go run ./ install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A3 \"cannot install\"\n\n🤖 Claude: Good! The check is working. But I notice it's using a different temp path than what was in your settings.json. Let me also clean up your settings file again:\n\nTool (Write): /Users/jason/git/hooks/.claude/settings.json\n\n🤖 Claude: Let's commit this fix:\n\nTool (Bash): git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Fix go run detection by checking for go-build in any cache location\n\n- Add checks for /go-build/ and /Caches/go-build/...\n\nTool (Bash): git push\n\n🤖 Claude: Perfect! The fix is now in place. The installation check now properly blocks `go run ./install` by detecting:\n- Temp directory paths (using `os.TempDir()`)\n- Any path containing `/go-build/` \n- Any...\n\n🧑 User: Write a simple Claude hook as a bash script in ~/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh that runs after tool use, and runs `gofmt -w` on any Go files that changed as a result of the tool.

Don't write code in this ...\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll create a bash script hook that runs `gofmt -w` on Go files that were changed by tool use.\n\nTool (Write): /Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh\n\nTool (Bash): chmod +x /Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's add this hook to the Claude settings:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/.claude/settings.json\n\nTool (Write): /Users/jason/.claude/settings.json\n\n🤖 Claude: Perfect! I've created a simple bash hook that:\n\n1. **Created `/Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh`** - A bash script that:\n   - Only runs on `PostToolUse` events\n   - Only processes `Edit`, `Write`...\n\n🧑 User: Let's test it! Add a bunch of blank lines at the top of notes.go and let's see if the hook runs\n\n🧑 User: Let's test it! Add a bunch of blank lines at the top of notes.go and let's see if the hook runs\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll add some blank lines at the top of notes.go to test the gofmt hook!\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Great! I've added several blank lines at the top of the file. Now let's check if the gofmt hook ran by looking at the file again:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\n\n🤖 Claude: The blank lines are still there. Let me check if there were any errors. Let's also verify the hook is working by checking stderr output:\n\nTool (Bash): ls -la /Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh \u0026\u0026 echo \"---\" \u0026\u0026 head -5 /Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh\n\n🤖 Claude: The hook exists and is executable. Let me check if gofmt would actually remove these blank lines:\n\nTool (Bash): gofmt -d internal/config/notes.go | head -20\n\n🤖 Claude: Good! `gofmt` would remove those blank lines. The hook might not have run or there might be an issue. Let me run the hook manually to debug:\n\nTool (Bash): CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENT_NAME=\"PostToolUse\" CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME=\"Edit\" CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT='{\"file_path\":\"/Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\"}' /U...\n\n🤖 Claude: Excellent! The hook worked when run manually and removed the blank lines. Let's check the file to confirm:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\n\n🧑 User: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks\n\n🧑 User: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me check the Claude Code hooks documentation to ensure the hook is set up correctly.\n\nTool (WebFetch): https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks\n\n🤖 Claude: I see - the hook receives JSON input via stdin, not through environment variables. Let me update the gofmt hook to read from stdin properly:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test the updated hook by adding blank lines again:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's check if the hook ran and removed the blank lines:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\n\n🤖 Claude: The blank lines are still there. Let me test the hook manually with the proper JSON format:\n\nTool (Bash): echo '{\"hook_event_name\":\"PostToolUse\",\"tool_name\":\"Edit\",\"tool_input\":\"{\\\"file_path\\\":\\\"/Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/config/notes.go\\\"}\"}' | /U...\n\n🤖 Claude: Perfect! The hook is working when tested manually. The issue might be that the hook isn't being called by Claude Code when we edit files. Let me check if there's an issue with the tool_input parsin...\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/.claude/hooks/gofmt.sh\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test once mo...",
