  "conversation_excerpt": "🧑 User: Nope, don't hard-code a bunch of paths, just look for os.TempDir.\n\n🤖 Claude: You're right, let me fix it to use `os.TempDir()` properly and also handle the `/tmp` symlink case:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test it:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o ~/go/bin/cnotes \u0026\u0026 go build -o /tmp/test-cnotes-final \u0026\u0026 /tmp/test-cnotes-final install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A3 \"cannot install\"\n\n🤖 Claude: Perfect! The temp directory check is now working. Let's commit these changes:\n\nTool (Bash): git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Prevent cnotes installation from temporary directories\n\n- Add check for os.TempDir() and /tmp/ prefix\n- Resolve symlin...\n\nTool (Bash): git push\n\n🤖 Claude: Done! The changes have been implemented:\n\n1. **Prevented installation from temporary directories** - cnotes now checks if the binary is running from a temp directory (using `os.TempDir()` and `/tmp...\n\n🧑 User: \u003cuser-memory-input\u003eDon't update the readme listing new features you're adding; the README is not a changelog. Remove the line about duplicate content.\u003c/user-memory-input\u003e\n\n🧑 User: (no content)\n\n🧑 User: Remove the line about duplicate content.\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll remove the line about duplicate content from the README as requested.\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/README.md\n\nTool (Bash): git add README.md \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Remove implementation detail from README\"\n\n🧑 User: `go run ./ install` worked and I thought we blocked that\n\n🤖 Claude: You're right! I see from the settings.json that `go run ./` created a binary at `/var/folders/3z/q0v7phks3lsc_ryxstdz5h3m0000gn/T/go-build2315954537/b001/exe/cnotes`, which is in the temp directory...\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test that `go run` is blocked:\n\nTool (Bash): go run ./ install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A3 \"cannot install\"\n\n🧑 User: Can we use os.TempDir instead? This would be consistent across platforms.\n\n🤖 Claude: You're right, we're already using `os.TempDir()` for the main check. Let me simplify the check to rely on that instead of hard-coding paths:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/install.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's test that both `/tmp` and `go run` are still blocked:\n\nTool (Bash): go run ./ install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A2 \"cannot install\" \u0026\u0026 echo \"---\" \u0026\u0026 go build -o /tmp/test \u0026\u0026 /tmp/test install 2\u003e\u00261 | grep -A2 \"cannot install\"\n\n🤖 Claude: Great! The check is working for `go run`. Let me check why `/tmp` didn't produce output:\n\nTool (Bash): ls -la /tmp/test 2\u003e\u00261\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me run it directly:\n\nTool (Bash): /tmp/test install 2\u003e\u00261 | head -5\n\n🤖 Claude: The `/tmp` check isn't working because on macOS, `/tmp` is a symlink to `/private/tmp`. Let me check what the resolved paths are:\n\nTool (Bash): ls -la /tmp \u0026\u0026 echo \"---\" \u0026\u0026 cd /tmp \u0026\u0026 pwd -P\n\nTool (Bash): ls -la /tmp | head -1 \u0026\u0026 readlink /tmp\n\n🤖 Claude: I see, `/tmp` is a symlink to `private/tmp` (which becomes `/private/tmp` when resolved). Let me update the check to handle this:\n\n🧑 User: I don't think we need to care too much about this, so long as `go run ./ install` is blocked. Clean up my claude settings though please, to only include the one that was go-installed\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll clean up the settings.json file to remove all the test entries and keep only the properly installed one.\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/.claude/settings.json\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll clean up the settings.json file to only keep the properly installed cnotes:\n\nTool (Write): /Users/jason/git/hooks/.claude/settings.json\n\n🤖 Claude: Done! I've cleaned up the `.claude/settings.json` file to only include the properly installed cnotes at `/Users/jason/go/bin/cnotes`. All the test entries have been removed.\n\nLet's commit all these...\n\nTool (Bash): git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Prevent go run install and clean up settings\n\n- Block installation when executable contains 'go-build' in path\n- Clean...",
