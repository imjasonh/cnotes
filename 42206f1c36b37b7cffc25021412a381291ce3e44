  "conversation_excerpt": "\nTool interactions:\n- Bash: command.\\n\\n2. **Project Structure Creation**: I created a comprehensive Go project with internal/ directory structure, types system, registry pattern, and CLI commands using cobra.\\n\\n3. **Hook Implementation**: Built example handlers for pre-tool-use (bash validation, sensitive file protection), post-tool-use (logging, goimports), user prompt (project context), and notifications (speech/visual).\\n\\n4. **Installation System**: Created install command with --global, --local flags, defaulting to project-level settings.\\n\\n5. **Critical JSON Format Issues**: User identified that hooks weren't triggering in real usage. Through research, I discovered Claude Code sends different JSON field names than expected:\\n   - `tool_name` instead of `tool`\\n   - `tool_input` instead of `tool_use_request`\\n   - `hook_event_name` for event identification\\n\\n6. **Decision Value Fix**: Found that Claude expects \\\"approve\\\" instead of \\\"continue\\\" for decisions.\\n\\n7. **Type Safety Improvements**: User identified type casting code smell, leading to creation of typed structs (BashToolInput, FileToolInput) with helper methods, but I initially just moved the casting to helper methods.\\n\\n8. **User Feedback on Type Casting**: User explicitly said \\\"You're just hiding the string casts, you're not getting rid of them!\\\" This led to a fundamental redesign where I changed `ToolUseRequest.Parameters` from `map[string]interface{}` to `json.RawMessage` and eliminated all `.(string)` assertions.\\n\\n9. **Scaffolding All Hook Events**: User requested scaffolding all remaining hook events (Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact) even without implementations.\\n\\n10. **Speech Removal**: User requested removing all references to speech/say commands from documentation.\\n\\n11. **Git Notes Feature Request**: User wanted to attach conversation logs to commits using git notes, with go-git library if possible. I researched feasibility and presented a plan.\\n\\n12. **Git Notes Implementation**: I implemented a complete system with:\\n    - `internal/notes/git_notes.go` for git operations\\n    - `internal/context/conversation.go` for transcript parsing\\n    - `internal/handlers/gitcommit.go` for the hook handler\\n    - `internal/config/notes.go` for configuration\\n\\n13. **Documentation Request**: User asked me to add examples to README showing how to use and view git notes.\\n\\n14. **Final Commit**: User requested committing the documentation changes.\\n\\n15. **Git Notes Testing**: User discovered git notes weren't being created and asked me to investigate. I found issues with JSON field mapping and commit hash extraction, then fixed them.\\n\\n16. **Notes Preservation System**: User requested ensuring rebasing and squashing doesn't lose data. I implemented comprehensive backup/restore system and warning hooks.\\n\\n17. **Pretty-Printed Show Command**: User requested a command to wrap \\\"git notes --ref=claude-conversations show \u003ccommit\u003e\\\" with Markdown formatting.\\n\\n18. **Conversation Formatting**: User asked to make tool interactions more readable with actual newlines. I implemented formatConversationExcerpt function.\\n\\n19. **Major Refactoring Request**: User requested removing all code that doesn't have to do with git notes, renaming to \\\"cnotes\\\" with restructured commands.\\n\\n20. **Timeout Fix**: User's final request was to make the base run command fail if stdin isn't sending data, which I implemented with a 2-second timeout.\\n\\nSummary:\\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\\n   The user's primary intent evolved through the conversation:\\n   - Initially: Create a comprehensive Go binary for Claude Code hooks with multiple hook handlers\\n   - Mid-conversation: Focus on git notes functionality to attach conversation context to commits\\n   - Final intent: Refactor to a focused \\\"cnotes\\\" tool that only handles git conversation notes, removing all other hook functionality\\n   - Last request: Ensure the base command fails quickly if no stdin input is provided\\n\\n2. [REDACTED] Concepts:\\n   - Claude Code hooks system with 7 event types (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact)\\n   - Go registry pattern for hook registration\\n   - Cobra CLI framework for command structure\\n   - JSON unmarshaling with typed structs vs map[string]interface{}\\n   - Git notes for metadata storage alongside commits\\n   - Privacy-aware conversation context extraction\\n   - Cross-platform notifications vs macOS-only speech synthesis\\n   - Type safety elimination of string casting\\n   - Stdin timeout handling with goroutines and channels\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n   - `main.go`: Entry point calling cmd.Execute(), updated module path to cnotes\\n   - `go.mod`: Module definition, changed from github.com/imjasonh/hooks to github.com/imjasonh/cnotes\\n   - `cmd/root.go`: Completely rewritten as main cnotes command that handles Claude Code hook calls\\n     ```go\\n     func runHook(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {...",
