  "conversation_excerpt": "🧑 User: I updated the default prompt limit, commit and push it\n\n🤖 Claude: I'll commit and push the change to the default prompt limit.\n\nTool (Bash): git add internal/config/notes.go \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Increase default max_prompts from 2 to 100\"\n\nTool (Bash): git push\n\n🤖 Claude: Done! The default `max_prompts` has been increased from 2 to 100, which will allow cnotes to capture many more user prompts in the conversation context.\n\n🧑 User: The notes for the latest commit include prompts and responses from the previous commit. We need to do a better job of deduping, without missing any transcript events\n\n🤖 Claude: You're right. The current implementation captures events from 60 seconds before the previous commit, which can include content that was already captured in that previous commit. We need a better de...\n\nTool (TodoWrite): {\"todos\":[{\"content\":\"Fix duplicate content between commits by implementing proper deduplication\",\"id\":\"12\",\"priority\":\"high\",\"status\":\"in_progress...\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me check the latest commit to see the duplication:\n\nTool (Bash): ./cnotes show HEAD | head -30\n\nTool (Bash): ./cnotes show HEAD~1 | tail -20\n\n🤖 Claude: I see the issue. The content from the previous commit (like the Edit to README.md and the TodoWrite) is appearing again in the next commit. We need a better approach than just using time-based filt...\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/notes/git_notes.go\n\n🤖 Claude: I need to add a field to track the last processed event timestamp. Let me update the ConversationNote structure:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/notes/git_notes.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now I need to update the conversation context extraction to track event timestamps and use the last event time from the previous commit:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/root.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me update the approach to get the last event time from the previous commit's note:\n\nTool (MultiEdit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/root.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now I need to track the last event time when creating the note. Let me update the ConversationContext to include the last event time:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now I need to update the parsing to track the last event time:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me update the parsing to track the last event time:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/internal/context/conversation.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now I need to update the root command to store the last event time in the note:\n\nTool (Read): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/root.go\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/cmd/root.go\n\n🤖 Claude: Now let's build and test this fix:\n\nTool (Bash): go build -o cnotes \u0026\u0026 cp cnotes /Users/jason/go/bin/cnotes\n\n🤖 Claude: Let me make a test commit to see if the deduplication is working:\n\nTool (Edit): /Users/jason/git/hooks/README.md\n\nTool (TodoWrite): {\"todos\":[{\"content\":\"Fix duplicate content between commits by implementing proper deduplication\",\"id\":\"12\",\"priority\":\"high\",\"status\":\"completed\"}]}\n\nTool (Bash): git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Implement proper deduplication using last event timestamp tracking\"",
