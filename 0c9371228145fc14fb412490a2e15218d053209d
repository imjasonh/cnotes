  "conversation_excerpt": "ðŸ¤– Claude: Good catch! The versions in the workflow are already the latest:\n- `actions/checkout@v4` - Latest version âœ“\n- `actions/setup-go@v5` - Latest version âœ“  \n- `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6` - L...\n\nðŸ‘¤ User: Great, commit and push that\n\nTool (Bash): git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions workflow for Go tests\n\n- Test with latest stable Go version\n- Run tests with race detector\n- Check ...\n\nTool (Bash): git push\n\nðŸ¤– Claude: Successfully committed and pushed! The GitHub Actions workflow is now set up and will run tests on all pushes to main and on pull requests.\n\nðŸ‘¤ User: Can we make sure we push notes when we push commits?\n\nðŸ¤– Claude: I'll create a git hook or update the workflow to ensure notes are pushed along with commits. Let me check the current setup first.\n\nTool (Bash): ls -la .git/hooks/ | grep -E \"(pre-push|post-commit)\"\n\nðŸ¤– Claude: Let me create a simple post-push hook that reminds you to push notes:\n\nTool (Write): /Users/jason/git/hooks/.git/hooks/post-push\n\nTool (Bash): chmod +x .git/hooks/post-push\n\nðŸ¤– Claude: Actually, I just realized that git doesn't have a post-push hook. Let me create a better solution - a git alias that pushes both commits and notes:\n\nTool (Bash): rm .git/hooks/post-push\n\nðŸ‘¤ User: What about a pre-push hook?\n\nðŸ¤– Claude: Yes! A pre-push hook is perfect for this. It can automatically push notes whenever you push commits.\n\nTool (Write): /Users/jason/git/hooks/.git/hooks/pre-push\n\nTool (Bash): chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push\n\nðŸ¤– Claude: Now whenever you run `git push`, it will automatically push the notes too! Let's test it:\n\nTool (Bash): echo \"test\" \u003e test-file.txt \u0026\u0026 git add test-file.txt \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"Test pre-push hook\"",
